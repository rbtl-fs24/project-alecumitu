## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Online survey by letting the respondents fill in a Google Form. The survey was advertised by placing QR codes inside the lab

2.  Methods for processing the data: Changed data from excel format to csv. Then changed column names and corrected any typos. After data I changed the csv file into a tidy form which is easier to use for tables and data visualization. The cleaned, tidy data that is directly used for analysis is found in tidy_data

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: -

4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: -

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions: Survey was conducted in a biology lab and the respondents were highly educated individuals who perform research as their daily activity.

6.  Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: Firstly, the accuracy of the data inputs is quite high due to the respondents interest in their field. Secondly, no data input from the respondents was changed during processing. The only procedure performed on the data was done in order to correct typos and transform our database into a readable, easier-to-use format.

7.  People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: Only the author, Alexandru Mitu, was responsible for collecting, processing, analysing and submitting the data.
